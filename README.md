# examplecode

In this repository, I uploaded my software tool that use in my currently project which is made me work faster and easiler but I can't put 
my main code in this becasue of the company policy. 

My currently project is about created software to transfer data between two server (once in Thailand and once in China).

1.pidapcapture is a software tool that use to check that the data was tranfered to other in the right format by reading pcap file 
and encoding byte data format into UTF format.

2.cassandratest is a software tool that use to test for inserting data into cassandra DB from csv file.
